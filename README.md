An implementation of the [Bitcask](https://riak.com/assets/bitcask-intro.pdf) paper from Riak. The result is a high-performance key-value store utilizing an on-disk write-ahead log (WAL) for persistence.

> **Note**: Aspects of this are still under development. See TODO/FIXME comments and TODO.md for and idea of what's not yet done and what is planned.
